Filenames with 4 numbers( like 1000-1000-5-35.png ) are in the form of
npart-nsamp-minBoxSize-maxBoxSize.png. Some of these prefactors were computed
by plugging into the fractal law equation, others may have been computed
through finding the regression line's intercepts.

The files in the "all" folder have the filename
"npart-actualPrefactor-actualDimension.png". These prefactors should have been
generated using the previous method of taking the intercept of the regression
line.

The .fig files were temporary saves while I was playing around with some of
the code, I doubt they express any interesting data.
